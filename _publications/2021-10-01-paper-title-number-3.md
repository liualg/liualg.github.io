title: "Viewing pictures of foods elicits taste-specific activity in gustatory insular cortex"

excerpt: 'Grounded theories of cognition claim that the neural substrates involved in object perception support both the perceptual and conceptual processing of those objects. Thus, the conceptual representation of food should involve brain regions associated with taste perception. This idea is supported by previous human neuroimaging research showing that viewing pictures of food (vs. non-food objects) activated taste-responsive regions of the insular cortex, thus suggesting that these pictures trigger an automatic retrieval of taste property information associated with the depicted foods.'
