excerpt: 'In the mammalian brain,the insula isthe primary cortical substrate involved inthe perception oftaste. Recent imaging studies in rodents
have identified a “gustotopic” organization inthe insula, whereby distinct insula regions are selectively responsiveto one ofthe five basic
tastes. However, numerous studies in monkeys have reported that gustatory cortical neurons are broadly-tuned to multiple tastes, and
tastes are not represented in discrete spatial locations. Neuroimaging studies in humans have thus far been unable to discern between
these two models, though this may be because of the relatively low spatial resolution used in taste studies to date. In the present study, we
examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain using ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) at high magnetic field strength (7-tesla).
