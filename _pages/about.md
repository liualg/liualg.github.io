Welcome! I'm Alexander, a post-baccalaureate researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health. My undergraduate degree in philosophy and biology paved a path towards neuropsychology. This unique field lets me to answer metaphysical questions in encountered in philosophy through quantitative means. My work in this area has lead me down many avenues, including taste perception, linguistics, machine learning, and computer science.     

Work and Research
======
I study taste perception in the human brain. I am trying to uncover the neural correlates of taste, and other factors that might further our understanding of the mind. To answer these questions, I utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), behavior experiments, and linguistic databases. Our experiments yield large datasets that required me to learn (and forever learning) Matlab, Python, R, HTML, CSS and Java Script. Through these languages I discovered artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NN). These artificial brains hold uncanny similarities to the human brain, and has given me new avenues to explore in my field of research. 

My current project examines the word semantics across cultures. Categories such as color and emotion have words that hold semantic meaning across cultures and language families. I am currently working to find other potential categories that could persist across cultures. 

Background
======
I received my philosophy B.A. and biology B.S. from Emory University. During these formative years I gained new perspectives of the world that has helped shaped the healthcare path that I am pursuing. Following my graduation, I moved to Washington D.C. to begin my post-baccalaureate intramural research training award (IRTA) at the National Institutes of Health. Since 2018, I have been working studying taste perception in the human brain in hopes to understand the neural correlates of taste to better help those who suffer with eating disorders. 

I have enjoyed living in our nations capitol and experiencing all it has to offer. In recent years I have taken up volunteering as an EMT as well as political activism for human rights as well as environmental sustainability. I am glad I have been able to utilize the skill sets I have acquired at Emory and the NIH to help address problems outside of science.
