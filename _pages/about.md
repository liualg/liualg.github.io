Welcome! I'm Alexander, a post-baccalaureate researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health. My undergraduate degree in philosophy and biology paved a path towards neuropsychology. This unique field lets me to answer metaphysical questions through quantitative means. My work in this area has lead me down many avenues, including linguistics, history, and computer science.     

Work and Research
======
I study taste perception in the human brain. I am trying to uncover the neural correlates of taste, and other factors that might further our understanding of the mind. To answer these questions, I utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), behavior experiments, and linguistic databases. Our experiments yield large datasets that required me to learn (and forever learning) Matlab, Python, R, CS, and HTML. Through these languages I discovered artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NN). The uncanny similarities to the human brain has given me a new avenue to explore and utilize in my research. 

My current project examines the word semantics across cultures. Categories such as color and emotion have words that hold semantic meaning across cultures and language families. I am currently working to find other potential categories that could persist across cultures. 

Background
======
I received my B.A. and B.S. in philosophy and biology from Emory University. During these formative years I gained new perspectives of the world that has helped shaped the healthcare path that I am pursuing. Following my graduation, I moved to Washington D.C. to begin my post-baccalaureate intramural research training award (IRTA) at the National Institutes of Health. Since 2018, I have been working studying taste perception in the human brain in hopes to under the neural correlates of taste to better help those who suffer with eating disorders.
