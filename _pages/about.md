My name is Alexander, I am currently working at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)! 
My work in this research has lead me down many avenues, including COVID-19, taste perception, linguistics, machine learning, and computer science. 
Currently expanding my knowlegde in project managment, data processing, and cloud analytics (AWS).

Work and Research
======
**Project Manager | Data Analyst:**
\
I am currently working at the National Cancer Institute to expand the nation’s capacity for SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing on a population-level and advance research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination among diverse and vulnerable populations.

The NCI's Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) is a coordinated effort to expand the nation’s capacity for SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing on a population-level and advance research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination among diverse and vulnerable populations.

CESDEP [learn more](https://frederick.cancer.gov/work-us/vendorssubcontractors/business-opportunities/center-excellence-serology-development-and-emergency-preparedness-cesdep)
The NCI's Center of Excellence for Serology Development and Emergency Preparedness (CESDEP) is tasked with the development of strategies for rapid deployment and expansion of SARS-CoV-2 serological and other immunological testing for public health benefit and pandemic control.

Background
======
I received my philosophy B.A. and biology B.S. from Emory University. During these formative years I gained new perspectives of the world that has helped shaped the healthcare path that I am pursuing. Following my graduation, I moved to Washington D.C. to begin my post-baccalaureate intramural research training award (IRTA) at the National Institutes of Health. Currently I am working remote helping understand and facillitate the collobration and sharing of COVID-19 research. 
\
**2021 - Present**: Due to my families at-risk status during the pandemic, I had to remove myself from my EMT work. My desire to help still persisted, so I shifted my work towards COVID-19. I wanted to contribute my knowledge and skillset to help with the pandemic. I applied to work as a data curator in NCI's Serological Sciences Network (SeroNet) to help with data ingestion and understanding of all of different research occuring around the United States. As the worlds understanding grew, so did my role. Our scope expanded past the curation of research to aquiring patient samples, data, and the sharing of such information. Currently I lead a team of 3 people in collaboration with 15+ instituites and external groups to advance research on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assist in the rapid deployment and expansion of SARS-CoV-2 serological and other immunological testing for public health benefit and pandemic control.
\
**From 2018 - 2021**: I studied taste perception in the human brain in hopes to understand the neural correlates of taste to better help those who suffer with eating disorders. To answer these questions, I utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), behavior experiments, and linguistic databases. Our experiments yield large datasets that required me to learn (and forever learning) Matlab, Python, R, HTML, CSS and Java Script. Through these languages I discovered artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks (NN). These artificial brains hold uncanny similarities to the human brain, and has given me new avenues to explore in my field of research. 
\
During this time I have taken up volunteering as an EMT as well as political activism for human rights as well as environmental sustainability. I am glad I have been able to utilize the skill sets I have acquired at Emory and the NIH to help address problems outside of science.
