Education
======
* B.S. Biology, Emory University, 2018
* B.S. Philosophy, Emory University, 2018
* Course Credit, NIH FAES, 2020
  * Basic Principles of Immunology and Hypersensitivity
  * Applied Machine Learning
  * Vision of NeuroScience 


Work experience
======
**Post-baccalaureate Research Fellow &#124; 2018 - Present**  
Intramural Research Training Award  
National Institute of Mental Health  
* Designs behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, implements large-scale data driven analysis, coordinates between NIH and other research groups, and presents findings at local and national conferences  
*Selected Project Experience*  
* *Food Picture: Regressors Analysis (current)*
  * Aggregated data from multiple sources for caloric density, fat content, and sugar density for our stimuli set
  * Designed behavioral web based experiments in Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) to find core dimensions of food and object representations in real-world images
  * Developed a data-driven computational model of similarity judgments for real-world images of 36 foods. The model captured most explainable variance in similarity judgments and produced 4 meaningful dimensions that reflect various conceptual and perceptual properties of these foods
* *Language semantics in the (current)*
  * Utilized data visualization packages in R, python, and Matlab to show cross-linguistic colexifcation patterns of emotion, colors, and taste related words in over 3000+ languages
* *Viewing pictures of foods elicits taste-specific activity in the gustatory insular cortex*
  * Implemented and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze visual patterns in 200,000+ images to help understand the visual pathway in humans. This reduced cost and time for behavioral data acquisition, and created a database of data for future studies
  * Created web based experiments to gather behavioral data on stimuli set 
* *Taste Quality Representation in the Human Brain*
  * Developed automated data processing pipelines in Unix Shell (bash), Python, and RStudio to improve data processing time by four fold. The code ultimately decreased constant user input and improved data processing and management

* Supervisor: Dr. Alex Martin, Dr. Jason Avery

**Prime Consulting &#124; 2016 - 2018**  
Consultant  
Atlanta, GA  
* Offered strong business analysis, deliverable creation, market research, and project management skills  
*Selected Project Experience*  
* Market sizing research effort for a French geo-analysis company
  * Drove a market sizing research effort to show the client possibilities of expanding business into North America
  * Explored data from multiple platforms and created visualizations for comprehensive “decks”
  * Interviewed similar business owners, lead scientists, and researched upcoming technology to identify possible platforms that would serve as entry into the U.S. economy
  * Served as liaison between the client and other research teams, effectively communicating risks and requirements of expansion into the U.S. market 

  
**Dilks Lab &#124; 2016 - 2018**  
Research Assistant  
Emory Universty, Georgia  
* Designed behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, implemented data driven analysis, managed and maintained medcial documentaion, and presented findings at conferences
* Duties included:
  * Created and implimented human behavioral tasks 
  * Used Unity and C# to create 3D enivroments for Experiments 
  * Learned to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure chances in brain blood flow 
* Supervisor: Dr. Daniel Dilks, Dr. Freddy Kamps
